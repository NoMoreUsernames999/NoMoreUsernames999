For assets not owned by Tempest051, but given license to them to use under agreement, Users must request use permissions from the Asset's original owners (for which a credits index "ReadMe" file can be found in the root directory of the Software if applicable). Credited names must appear somwhere in the User's project page of the softwares which are borrowing Assets, with a detailed list of the Asset owners and the associated Asset borrowed, modified, or otherwise used.

In the case of such an event, Users must cease all use of the aforementioned Assets, including but not limited to; removing any and all instances of affected softwares from sites with the purpose of hosting for public distribution until said softwares have had any Assets covered by this License removed, and cease immediately any and all private and/ or public distribution of Assets to which this condition applies. The Copyright holder Tempest051, or persons assoicated with their projects, while not required by the conditions of this license, will make reasonable attempts to inform the affected Users of the termination of their use rights to Softwares under this license.
