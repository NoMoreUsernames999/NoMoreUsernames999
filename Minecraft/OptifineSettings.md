## The following is an explenation of the Optifine mod's settings. 

***Settings that do not affect performance or compatibility are omitted.*** 

- **Graphics: Fancy/ Fast:**
    This simply sets the graphics preset. Any option not on default will override this setting.
- **Smooth lighting:**
    This setting changes how much block lighting is smoothed. The performance difference maximum and minimum can be very noticeable on some systems. If using shaders, it's recommended you leave this at no higher than 50%.
- **Use VBOs:**
    Uses alternate rendering that may be faster. Switches rendering to be more graphics intensive. If you have an old GPU or use integrated graphics, do not enable. Otherwise it's recommended. 
- **Details:**
    All options in "details" are visual only and up to user preference. If you have a shader enabled, you should have clouds and fog off, and vignette set to fast. 
- **Mipmap levels:**
    Contrary to what Optifine says, this does affect performance. Use if you want, unless you have integrated graphics.
- **Smooth FPS:**
    This can help give smoother avg fps. Doesn't really do anything on integrated graphics. 
- **Fast math:**
    Does the same thing as the BetterFPS mod. Sadly incompatible with most mods. Do not enable this. 
- **Fast render:**
    Can also drastically improve performance. Tends to cause visual bugs with a lot of mods, use at your own risk. 
- **Render regions:**
    Explained in the tooltip. Incompatible with this modpack.  
- **Smart animations:**
    Explained in the tooltip. May give a noticeable fps boost on slower computers. Has been known to cause visual bugs with some mods, so use at your own risk.  
- **Dynamic updates:**
    CPU dependent. Most noticeable with higher render distances. Can help load the world faster when stationary. Note that this does increase CPU usage when running updates. 
- **Lazy chunk loading:**
    Similar to the above, speeds up world load somewhat. For those with weaker computers, enabling this will probably help with worldgen inside cities. May occasionally cause weird visual bugs.  
- **Autosave interval:**
    Setting this to 6-12 minutes can help with lag spikes. On rare occasions it may cause a few minutes of data loss if the world crashes in between saves without saving properly (I've only experienced it once).
