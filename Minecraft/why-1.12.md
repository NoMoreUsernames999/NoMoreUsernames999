# An explanation of why I stick to Minecraft 1.12.2
#### This file is linked to various bot responses and project descriptions to explain why I stick to this version of Minecraft, so that I don't have to keep repeating myself. And maybe people who feel the same way can also give people this link, to save themselves some breath as well.
"Why do you play on a dead version?"  
"Why do you hate new versions so much?"  
"Why don't you just update?"  
I've had this asked many times, and I'm sure if you play old versions, you've heard this a lot too. If you asked me this and were given this link, you misunderstand my stance on newer versions. Let me explain.  
First off, if you are lazy and don't like reading, then TL;DR:  

As a packdev, 1.12 has too many useful mods that don't exist on newer versions, and I wouldn't be able to create the same content. I do not hate new versions, I juust don't *develop* for them.  

Now for the long version:  

There are two reaons I stick to 1.12 for dev work:

1: I don't hate new versions. In fact some of my favourite modpacks are on newer versions. Now it is true that I tend to play 1.12 packs the most, but that's because I generally dislike the direction that Minecraft went in.  
The modding community in newer versions has moved more towards "Vanilla+" and mods that match Minecraft's style. An example would be vehicle mods in older versions having styles like McHeli and Immersive Vehicles, while vehicle mods in newer versions being in the style of Create and Valkyrian contraptions. Don't get me wrong, these are cool, but they just aren't my style. I like mods that stray from the vanilla gameplay.  
Another example would be gun mods being made with a style of Mr Crayfish instead of Vic's Warfare. While all this Vanilla+ movement is not necessarily a bad thing, I don't play Minecraft for Minecraft. I play it for what I can turn Minecraft into.  
I view Minecraft as a sort of game engine, and mods as "feature blocks" that I can use to build a game. Can't find a good pirate game? Build it in Minecraft. Can't find a good space game? Build it in Minecraft. The possibilities of a sandbox like Minecraft in a modded environment is what drew me to the game in the first place.  
And that brings me to my second point;  

2: Newer versions lack pack dev utility mods. What do I mean by this? Well, because Minecraft has moved more towards Vanilla+, there are less mods that let you drastically modify the game because that's just not a thing people are interested in as much as before.  
The second reason for the drop in utility mods is that Mojang doesn't care about modders, and the changes they've been making have hurt the modding community. More frequent updates force modders to spend more time constantly porting instead of perfecting their mods, and of course utiltiy mods usually take the longest to build so they are the most affected by this.  
The third reason for the drop in utility mods is the overuse of data packs. Data packs are awesome, yes, but they are being used for more than they should, and it's killed the utility modding scene a bit because instead of people thinking "hey, I need to do this thing, I'll make a mod for it!" They instead think "hey, I need to do this thing, lets try increasingly convoluted methods through data packs to cobble it together."  
While data packs are powerful, they are nothing compared to actual mods, and heavily limited. Things like what JED or DimensionalControl are capable of simply can't be replicated with data packs (not to mention the complexity of Recurrent Complex structure rules).  
Now you might be wondering: "What are all these utilities you keep referring to and how could they possibly be this important?" Off the top of my head; JustEnoughDimensions, CustomNPC, CaveGenerator, RecurrentComplex, CofH World, BetterQuesting, and LostBooks, just to name a few.  
While you might be able to replicate the features of CofH using a data pack, it would take more effort. And the rest would simply be impossible. Just these mods allow me to literally create entire dimensions with customized terrain generation and other features, that imo, look better than anything 1.18 has to offer. And of course since my packs are story based RPGs, not having CustomNPC and RecurrentComplex is itself a deal breaker. The packs I like to create simply wouldn't be possible on newer versions.  
So I still do ocasionally play newer versions if I find a modpack that is unique enough (and by this I mean strays from Vanilla gameplay in a way that no other does), I just don't develop for them.  
I have yet to come up with a modpack idea that I was unable to find the mods and methods for to implement on 1.12. The shear amount of mods and utilities means I can create more unique modpacks than I could ever possibly have the time for.  

You might dislike older versions because "I've played all the mods, it's boring now." But this is probably because you played packs that followed the same old generic gameplay loop. After a while, ya it gets boring. Most pack devs just copy each other instead of trying something new, using the same old mods in the same old way, in the same old progression style. But the few that come up with truly unique ideas create a whole new gameplay experience.  
Before you pass judgement on a "outdated version" (ridiculous term imo), I recommend you try playing some of these packs if you haven't already (I'll not include any of mine because of creator bias, except one since I haven't seen anyone do something even remotely similar to it in the past): Rebirth of The Night, Dimension Hopper, Trepidation, Underdog, Last Days of Humanity, Origins Redux, Compact Clausterphobia, Feed The Factory, TolkienCraft, Attack of The Johns, Hardcore Alchemy, and I've heard good things about Meatballcraft. And some special mentions from 1.7- in case you haven't played older versions at all; Greg Tech New Horizons (yes, the memeist of memes, but it is arguably one of the most impressive packs), Terra Firma Rescue, Crash Landing, & Regrowth.   
If you still think "insert new version" is better, then to each their own.  
(As of writing, not all of the above packs are complete yet).
