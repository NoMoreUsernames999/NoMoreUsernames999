The following is the license used in my Minecraft modding projects.

You may use any of the assets of this project in your own under the following conditions: 

-You give proper credit. This includes crediting me and anyone else that is part of this project if you are using assets they created. For assets I do not own, you will have to request permission from their creators like I did. Check the ReadMe and Credits files in the root directory of this project file if there is one. Credited names must appear somewhere in your project page (usually the end), and a more detailed Credits.txt file must be included in the root directory if complete information isn't included in your project description. You can copy paste the relevant lines from the Credits.txt file of this project relating to which assets you used. 
-You follow Mojang's TOS of no paywalling. 
-Any forks must state in their title or description that they are forks. 
-If you modify any assets, you must state so in the project description.   
-You do not reupload your project to sites other than Curseforge and Modrinth if it contains assets owned by T3mp3st051, without their express permission. 
-You include this license in your project.
